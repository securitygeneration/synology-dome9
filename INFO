description="This (unofficial) package installs the Dome9 Agent in order to allow you to control your Synology NAS firewall using the Dome9 service (http://dome9.com). Note: it is recommended to add ports TCP/22 (SSH) and TCP/5000 (Web Interface) to the Dome9 Emergency Policy Configuration, so that you retain the ability to connect to your NAS in the event it cannot communicate with the Dome9 service."
